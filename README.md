# Webiste created with Gatsby.js

 > The goal of this project is not to look pretty, but to master new technologies and create functionality in them.

### In this project I used:
* Gastby
* GraphQL
* Gatsby - image
* Creat blog post with MDX file
* Then blog and all sites are conecte with Headless CMS Dato CMS
* Deploy to Netlify (But now isn't exist)

Website is easy to develop. Can be add mobile friendly layout, more styles and animation.
It,s really easy to conect form with Firebase and SendGrid.
